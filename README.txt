# BitSim
No need to download Bitlife. There's Bitlife at home... A GUI (JavaFX 1.8) game made inspiring heavily from Bitlife and Sims. 

This game has the ability to save and load games from txt files. The button Surrender is basically another way to quit the game. 
When we start a new life, a baby sim borns... But we can always load a sim from any age and continue their life. But, when
a sim comes to the age of 100, the grim reaper won't leave them alone! They cannot run away. This game is a life simulation
game. Every time an event happens, the sim writes them into their diaries, called story. Unlike bitlife, sims must complete
their K-12 education. There is no drop out. College is not free in this game too. Life is cruel. So, the sim must work a little
bit to save some money for college. When the sim has enough money, they can buy a house, or a car! When they struggle financially, or just
whenever, they can sell their assets. Also, when a sim starts feeling sick, they are probably sick. They should go to doctor 
and be treated. Then they will feel much better!
